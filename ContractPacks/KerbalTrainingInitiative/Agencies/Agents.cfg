This is why I'm squatting in this only partially occupied office. Since founding the Kerbal Resources & Relations (KRR) Division this Tuesday, I've seen a marked reduction in Kerbal complaints, which nobody has yet managed to prove was related in any way to the recent rash of coincidental disappearances and visits from shadowy, threatening figures. If you think about it carefully, I'm sure you'll agree that you need my services." - excerpt from a recent memo from Edwin Kerman, KRR Division

'Professor Dinkelstein used me as a doorstop.' 'You flew a rocket with a crew of 25 directly into the sun.' Blah, blah, blah. There's just no winning with these people. Well, I don't know, I suppose you could try doing what they want, but that sounds a lot like hard work to me." - excerpt from a recent memo from Edwin Kerman, KRR Division
